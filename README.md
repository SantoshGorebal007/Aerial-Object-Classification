# Aerial Object Classification & Detection 

 This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution that can classify aerial images into two categories  Bird or Drone  and optionally perform object detection to locate and label these objects in real-world scenes.
The solution will help in security surveillance, wildlife protection, and airspace safety where accurate identification between drones and birds is critical. The project involves building a Custom CNN classification model, leveraging transfer learning, and optionally implementing YOLOv8 for real-time object detection. The final solution will be deployed using Streamlit for interactive use.
